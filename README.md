Practice exercises in Python 2 based on "Effective Python" book.

NOTE: the book already focuses on Python 3. 
In this repository, I will try to highlight the differences in Python 2.
The ideas presented in the book are applicable to both Python 2 and 3. 
However, not everyone can easily move to Python 3, especially in large corporates where teams already have lots of works in Python 2.
