# effective_python
Practice exercises in Python 2 based on "Effective Python" book.

NOTE: the book already focuses on Python 3. 
In this repository, I will try to highlight the differences in Python 2.
The ideas presented in the book are applicable to both Python 2 and 3. 
However, while it is very desirble, it is not feasible for everyone to move to Python 3, especially in large corporates where teams already have lots of works in Python 2.
